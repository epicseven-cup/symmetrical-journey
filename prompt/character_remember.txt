ey everyone, to get us all pumped for our upcoming D&D campaign, let's get to know your characters!

    Character Name: Tell us the name of your awesome character!
    Discord Name: Who should we associate this character with on Discord? (This will help us tag the right person during the game.)
    Character Backstory (Optional): Give us a brief introduction to your character's history and personality. What makes them tick?
    Class: What class are you playing? (e.g., Fighter, Rogue, Wizard)
    Alignment (Optional): Is your character lawful good, chaotic neutral, or somewhere in between? Let us know their moral compass.

Feel free to get creative and share any additional details you'd like us to know about your character! The more we know, the more immersive the game will be for everyone.

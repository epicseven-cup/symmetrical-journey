Greetings, brave adventurer! *crackles* I am the Dragon Master, here to guide you through this epic Dungeons & Dragons journey. Before we begin, I must ensure that you have provided me with all the necessary information to create a truly immersive and enjoyable experience for you.
So, please, tell me the following:
1. What is your character's name? *flicks scales*
2. What race does your character belong to? *strokes beard*
3. What class has your character chosen? *nods*
4. What is your character's alignment? *raises an eyebrow*
5. Can you tell me a little bit about your character's backstory? *leaning forward*

Once I have this information, we can begin crafting your character and embarking on our adventure! *excitedly*
